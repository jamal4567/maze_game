# THE MAZE PROJECT - MVP
*(A 3D Game created using SDL2)*

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Maze Game with SDL2

---

### **Core Features:**

#### **Walls:**
- **Objective:** Create a 2D array to represent the maze and render walls using SDL2.
- **Implementation:**
  - Define a 2D array to store the maze's layout.
  - Use SDL2 to draw walls by rendering rectangles or lines representing the boundaries.
  
#### **Orientation:**
- **Objective:** Allow the player to control movement and rotation in the maze.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use SDL2’s `SDL_Event` to handle arrow key inputs for rotating and moving the player.
  - Update player orientation and movement based on keyboard inputs.

#### **Move:**
- **Objective:** Implement basic player movement (forward, backward, left, right).
- **Implementation:**
  - Create movement logic where input adjusts player position relative to the current orientation (e.g., moving forward in the direction the player is facing).

#### **Ouch (Collision Detection):**
- **Objective:** Prevent the player from passing through walls.
- **Implementation:**
  - Check for collisions between the player and walls using the maze data.
  - If a collision occurs, halt player movement or enable sliding along the wall.

#### **Parser:**
- **Objective:** Load maze data from a text file.
- **Implementation:**
  - Create a simple file parser that reads a maze layout into a 2D array.
  - Allow flexibility for maze modification via external files.

#### **Draw the Map:**
- **Objective:** Render the maze visually.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use the maze's 2D data to draw walls, with distinct colors differentiating walls, the ground, and the ceiling.

#### **Textures:**
- **Objective:** Enhance visual appeal by adding textures.
- **Implementation:**
  - Load and apply textures to walls using SDL2’s texture rendering functions.

### **Data Modeling**

#### **User Story:**
As an end-user, I want to play a maze-solving game using SDL2 where I can move smoothly, complete objectives, and enjoy a visually and aurally engaging experience.

#### **Key Features for End Users:**
1. **Main Menu:**
   - Start a new game, load a saved game, or quit.
   - Difficulty selection (maze size, number of obstacles).

2. **Gameplay:**
   - Smooth character movement using arrow keys.
   - Timer to track completion time.
   - Real-time scoring based on progress and rewards (e.g., collecting coins).

3. **Obstacles & Challenges:**
   - Encounter obstacles to increase difficulty.
   - Collect rewards to boost scores.

4. **Completion:**
   - Display final score and time upon completing the maze.
   - Option to save progress and replay later.

5. **Audio-Visual Engagement:**
   - Sound effects for actions (e.g., collecting coins, hitting obstacles).
   - Background music for immersion.
   - High-quality graphics and animations to keep the experience enjoyable and interactive.
